Compute the normalised projected policy error. This error measures the 
difference between the policy subject to the true constraints, and that of 
the policy subject to the estimated constraints.

input: 
    U_t: true observation
    N_p: learnt projection matrix
    P_i: true nullspace policy
output
    nPPE: normalised projected policy error
    vPPE: variance of the nullspace policy
    uPPE: projected policy error
